    content: `I propose that we collectively undertake an initiative to green our neighborhood by planting more trees and shrubs. More greenery will improve air quality, create more pleasant places to spend time, and enhance the aesthetics of our surroundings. Together, we can organize a fundraising campaign and choose plant species that best fit our area. I believe this initiative will benefit all residents and make our neighborhood a more welcoming place to live.`,
